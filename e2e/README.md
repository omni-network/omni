# End-to-End Tests

Spins up and tests Omni devnets in Docker Compose based on a testnet manifest. To run the CI testnet:

```sh
# In repo root
# Install the e2e app
go install github.com/omni-network/omni/e2e

# Build docker image of the code to test.
make build-docker

# Run one of the "manifests" in networks/ directory: e2e -f <manifest>
e2e -f e2e/networks/single.toml
```

This creates and runs a testnet named `single` under `e2e/runs/single/`.

## Conceptual Overview

Please refer to the [cometBFT E2E test framework](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/tree/main/test/e2e) for more details.

In order to perform any action on a network (deploy/test/show logs), the following process is followed to create a network `Definition`:
1. A network is initially declared in a `manifest` file, see [manifests/](./manifests) folder. It defines the desired network topology. See the `e2e/types#Manifest` type for details.
2. Then the infrastructure provider (only `docker compose` supported at the moment) subsequently generates the `e2e/types#InfrastructureData` from the manifest. This defines the instance IPs and ports of everything we will deploy.
3. Subsequently, we generate a `Testnet` struct which is basically contains all the configuration/keys/peers/images/files/folders required to deploy a network. See `e2e/types#Testnet` for details.
4. We then instantiate a `netman.Manager` which is responsible for deploying portals. It takes a `Testnet` struct as input.
5. Finally, we instantiate new `InfrastructureProvider` which can deploy the network. It takes a `Testnet` struct and `InfrastructureData` as input.

These objects are then wrapped in a `e2e/app#Definition` that can be used to perform any action on a network.

## Test Stages

The e2e test has the following stages, which can also be executed explicitly by running `e2e -f <manifest> <stage>`:

* `setup`: generates configuration files.

* `start`: starts Docker containers.

* `wait`: waits for a few blocks to be produced, and for all nodes to catch up to it.

* `stop`: stops Docker containers.

* `cleanup`: removes configuration files and Docker containers/networks.

Auxiliary commands:

* `logs`: outputs all node logs.

* `tail`: tails (follows) node logs until canceled.
