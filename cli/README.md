# Omni CLI

Omni CLI is a tool for operators and other actors in the Omni ecosystem.

## Installation

For installation and usage instructions, please refer to the [Omni Documentation](https://docs.omni.network/tools/cli/).

## Operators

Operators can register for the Omni AVS using this cli. It's directly compatible with operators' Eigenlayer configurations – `operator.yaml` and keys generated by the [eigenlayer-cli](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenlayer-cli).
