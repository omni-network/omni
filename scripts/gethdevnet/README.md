# geth-dev-net

This package provides a docker-compose file to run a fully-functional, local development network Ethereum execution client (geth).

It is configured in "proof-of-stake" mode, so ready for halo to drive it via the Engine API.

It was forked from [eth-pos-devnet](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/eth-pos-devnet).
