# MinRetainBlocks defines the minimum block height offset from the current
# block being committed, such that all blocks past this offset are pruned
# from CometBFT. It is used as part of the process of determining the
# ResponseCommit.RetainHeight value during ABCI Commit. A value of 0 indicates
# that no blocks should be pruned.

# This configuration value is only responsible for pruning CometBFT blocks.
# It has no bearing on application state pruning which is determined by the
# "pruning-*" configurations.

# snapshot parameters to determine the correct minimum value of
# ResponseCommit.RetainHeight.
