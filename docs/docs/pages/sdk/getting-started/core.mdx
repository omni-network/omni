# Getting Started using the core package

## Overview

The Omni SDK contains APIs for interfacing with Omni SolverNet, your gateway to enabling any transaction, on any chain, from any supported JavaScript runtime.

## Prerequisites

You'll need to have `viem` setup in your project already. If you don't, you can follow the instructions here: [Viem Getting Started Guide](https://viem.sh/docs/getting-started).

## Installation

Once your project meets the prerequisites, install the SDK package:

:::code-group
```bash [pnpm]
pnpm i @omni-network/core
```

```bash [npm]
npm i @omni-network/core
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add @omni-network/core
```
:::


## Setup

### Environment

The SDK supports the following environments for interacting with the SolverNet APIs:

- `mainnet` for production (default when not specified)
- `testnet` for development and testing

Some of the SDK functions support providing the environment as a parameter. If not provided, the SDK will use `mainnet`.

### Contracts

Functions interacting with blockchains need to be provided the contract addresses, which can be loaded using the `getContracts()` function:

```ts
import { getContracts, getOrder } from '@omni-network/core'

const mainnetAddresses = getContracts() // mainnet environment by default
const testnetAddresses = getContracts('testnet')

const order = await getOrder({
  client: publicClient,
  inboxAddress: mainnetAddresses.inbox,
  orderId: '0x123...',
})
```

### Viem clients

The SDK uses [`viem` clients](https://viem.sh/) for blockchain interactions.

Most functions only perform read operations using a [Public Client](https://viem.sh/docs/clients/public), however the order creation functions (`sendOrder`, `openOrder` and `generateOrder`) need to be provided a [Wallet Client](https://viem.sh/docs/clients/wallet) able to sign transactions.

```ts
import { getOrder, openOrder } from '@omni-network/core'
import { createPublicClient, createWalletClient, custom, http } from 'viem'
import { mainnet } from 'viem/chains'

// Example Public Client from viem's documentation
const publicClient = createPublicClient({
  chain: mainnet,
  transport: http()
})
// Retrieving a known order only needs a Public Client
const order = await getOrder({
  client: publicClient,
  inboxAddress: mainnetAddresses.inbox,
  orderId: '0x123...',
})

// Example Wallet Client from viem's documentation
const walletClient = createWalletClient({
  chain: mainnet,
  transport: custom(window.ethereum!)
})
// Opening an order requires a Wallet Client
const order = await openOrder({
  client: walletClient,
  inboxAddress: mainnetAddresses.inbox,
  order: orderParameters,
})
```
