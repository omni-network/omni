# `useOrder`

After obtaining a valid quote with [`useQuote`](/sdk/hooks/useQuote), the `useOrder` hook is used to execute the actual cross-chain transaction via Omni SolverNet. It takes the details confirmed in the quote, validates them, and provides a function (`open`) to initiate the process and monitor its status.

<Callout type="warning" title="Note">
Fetching the destination chain transaction hash may fail if you're using a public RPC provider. Internally, we use viems watchContractEvent to listen for the `Fill` event, but this isn't reliable when working with public RPCs. It's strongly recommended to use a private RPC provider anyway, to prevent instability or rate limiting issues.
</Callout>

## Usage

`import { useOrder } from '@omni-network/react'`

```tsx
import { useOrder } from '@omni-network/react'

function Component() {
  const order = useOrder({
    // ... params
  });
}
```

## Parameters

| Prop                | Type                                 | Required | Description                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------ | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `srcChainId`        | `number`                             | Yes      | The chain ID of the source chain. Must match `useQuote`.                                                                          |
| `destChainId`       | `number`                             | Yes      | The chain ID of the destination chain. Must match `useQuote`.                                                                     |
| `deposit`           | `Deposit`                         | Yes      | Describes the asset and amount being deposited on the source chain (paid by the user) - taken from `quote.deposit`. |
| `expense`           | `Expense`  | Yes      | Describes the asset, amount, and spender on the destination chain (paid by the solver) - taken from `quote.expense`.            |
| `calls`             | `Call[]`                             | Yes      | An array of contract calls to be executed on the destination chain by the solver.                                                     |
| `validateEnabled`   | `boolean`                            | No       | Defaults to `true`. Enables pre-validation of the order with Omni. Use this to validate your calls. Recommended to set based on `quote.isSuccess`.                    |
| `omniContractsQueryOpts`      | `UseQueryOptions<OmniContracts>`  | No       | React query options for loading the Omni contracts addresses, we omit some keys here (`enabled`, `queryKey`, and `queryFn`) to prevent overriding some default behaviour. See [`useQuery`](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/react/reference/useQuery) docs for available options. |
| `getOrderQueryOpts`           | `UseQueryOptions<GetOrderReturn>` | No       | React query options for loading the order, we omit some keys here (`enabled`, `queryKey`, and `queryFn`) to prevent overriding some default behaviour. See [`useQuery`](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/react/reference/useQuery) docs for available options. |
| `didFillQueryOpts`            | `UseQueryOptions<boolean>`        | No       | React query options for loading the filled status of the order, we omit some keys here (`enabled`, `queryKey`, and `queryFn`) to prevent overriding some default behaviour. See [`useQuery`](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/react/reference/useQuery) docs for available options. |

## Types

### Deposit

Describes the deposit parameter.

```typescript
type Deposit = {
  readonly token?: Address
  readonly amount: bigint
}
```

### Expense

Describes the expense parameter.

```typescript
type Expense = {
  readonly spender?: Address
  readonly token?: Address
  readonly amount: bigint
}
```

### Order

Describes the order to placed by the user.

```typescript
export type Order<abis extends OptionalAbis> = {
  readonly owner?: Address
  readonly srcChainId?: number
  readonly destChainId: number
  readonly fillDeadline?: number
  readonly calls: Calls<abis>
  readonly deposit: Deposit
  readonly expense: Expense
}
```

### Call

Describes a contract interaction on the destination chain.

```typescript
type Call = {
  target: Address;      // The contract address to call
  abi: Abi;             // The ABI of the target contract
  functionName: string; // The function to call - type inferred from the abi
  args?: unknown[];     // Arguments for the function call - type inferred from the abi
  value?: bigint;       // ETH value to send with the call (optional)
}
```

## Return

### open

`() => void`

### status

`'initializing' | 'ready' | 'opening' | 'open' | 'closed' | 'rejected' | 'error' | 'filled'`

Monitor the `status` to provide feedback to user's throughout the lifecycle of the cross-chain transaction.

### validation

The result of the pre-validation check if `validateEnabled` is true.

`{
  status: 'pending' | 'rejected' | 'accepted',
  rejectReason?: string,
  rejectDescription?: string
}
`

### error
`Error | undefined`

Contains error information if `status` is `'error'`.

### isReady

`true` when the hook is initialized and ready to attempt opening the order (status is `'ready'`). Does *not* imply validation passed.


### txMutation
`UseMutationResult<...>`

The raw mutation result object from `wagmi` for the opening transaction.

### txHash
`Hex | undefined`

The hash of the source chain transaction used to open the order.

### destTxHash
`Hex | undefined`

The hash of the destination chain transaction that filled the order.

### waitForTx
`UseWaitForTransactionReceiptReturnType`

The result object from `wagmi`'s `useWaitForTransactionReceipt` for the opening transaction.

### isValidated
`boolean`

`true` if the validation check has completed (regardless of outcome).

### isOpen
`boolean`

`true` if the order has been successfully opened (`status === 'open'`).

### isError
`boolean`

`true` if `status` is `'error'`.

### isTxPending
`boolean`

`true` while the source chain transaction for opening the order is being submitted (part of `'opening'` status).

### isTxSubmitted
`boolean`

`true` once the source chain transaction has been submitted (part of `'opening'` status).
