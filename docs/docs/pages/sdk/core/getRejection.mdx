# `getRejection`

<Callout type="warning" title="Note">
This API should only be called if the order status is - `rejected`
</Callout>

The `getRejection` function will filter logs on the inbox contract in the block range between the `fromBlock` block number - `latest`. Logs are filtered for a `Rejected` event with an argument matching the specified `orderId. It return the reject reason and tx hash of the rejection.

Rejections can typically be avoided by validating orders via our solver API (see the [`validateOrder` function](/sdk/core/validateOrder)). However, for the best UX, we've offered this api to present reject reasons to your users if a rejection were to occur.

## Usage

`import { getRejection } from '@omni-network/core'`

```tsx
import { getRejection } from '@omni-network/core'

const { rejectReason, txHash } = await getRejection({
  // ... params
});
```

## Reject Reasons

The `rejectReason` is returned as a string for you already, but below are the possible reasons.

```typescript
export const rejectReasons = {
  0: 'None',
  1: 'Destination call reverts',
  2: 'Invalid deposit',
  3: 'Invalid expense',
  4: 'Insufficient deposit',
  5: 'Solver has insufficient inventory',
  6: 'Unsupported deposit',
  7: 'Unsupported expense',
  8: 'Unsupported destination chain',
  9: 'Unsupported source chain',
  11: 'Expense over max',
  12: 'Expense under min',
  13: 'Call not allowed',
}
```

## Parameters

| Prop              | Type                                   | Required | Description                                                                                                                                |
| -------------     | -------------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `client`          | `Client`                               | Yes      | The `viem` client used to send the transaction. This client must have an `account` attached to it.  |
| `inboxAddress`    | `Hex`                               | Yes      | The address of the inbox contract, retrieved using the [`getContracts`](/sdk/core/getContracts) function.  |
| `orderId`         | `Hex`                          | Yes      | Order identifier defined on a [`ResolvedOrder`](/sdk/core/waitForOrderOpen#resolvedorder) |
| `fromBlock`       | `bigint`                               | Yes      | The first block to begin filtering for a `Rejected` event. We recommend to use the block number the `open` transaction belonged to (returned by `sendOrder` or `generateOrder`)  |

## Return

### rejectReason
`string | undefined`

The reason the order was rejected.

### txHash
`Hex | undefined`

The hash of the transaction that rejected the order.

## Example

```ts
import { getRejection } from '@omni-network/core'

const { txHash, rejectReason } = await getRejection({
  client: viemWalletClient,
  inboxAddress: contracts.inbox,
  orderId: resolvedOrder.orderId,
  fromBlock: 1n
})
```
