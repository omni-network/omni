# `withExecAndTransfer`

Use the `withExecAndTransfer` utility for interacting with destination contracts that accept native token deposits, and return dynamic tokenized positions.

For example:

- Alice deposits 1 ETH into a contract
- Alice receives some dynamic amount of vTokens (value tokens) in return


<Callout type="info">
    This utility only supports native token deposits.
    Work is in progress to support ERC20 token deposits.
</Callout>



## How it Works

This utility wraps your intended destination contract call (`call`) within another call targeting the `SolverNetMiddleman` contract. When the solver fulfills the intent:

1.  The `SolverNetMiddleman` contract is called on the destination chain.
2.  The `SolverNetMiddleman` executes the target `call` specified (e.g., `Vault.deposit()` which credits vault shares to `msg.sender`).
3.  After the original `call` completes, the `SolverNetMiddleman` (which *was* the `msg.sender` and received the assets) checks its own balance of a specified `token`.
4.  It transfers the *entire balance* of that `token` it holds to the specified final recipient address (`to`).

Here's the relevant part of the `SolverNetMiddleman` contract:

```solidity
contract SolverNetMiddleman {
    // ...

    /**
     * @notice Execute a call and transfer any received tokens back to the recipient
     * @dev Intended to be used when interacting with contracts that don't allow us to specify a recipient
     * @param token  Token to transfer (address(0) for ETH)
     * @param to     Recipient address
     * @param target Call target address
     * @param data   Calldata for the call
     */
    function executeAndTransfer(
        address token,
        address to,
        address target,
        bytes calldata data
    ) external payable nonReentrant {
        (bool success, ) = target.call{value: msg.value}(data); // Executes the original call
        if (!success) revert CallFailed();

        // Transfer received assets to the intended recipient
        if (token == address(0)) {
            SafeTransferLib.safeTransferAllETH(to);
        } else {
            IERC20(token).safeTransferAll(to); // safeTransferAll checks balance and transfers if > 0
        }
    }

    // ...
}
```

**Key Points:**

*   The `token` in the `transfer` configuration of `withExecAndTransfer` is the address of the asset you expect the *middleman* to receive *as a result of* executing your `call`. This is the asset the middleman will forward to the final `to` address. Use `zeroAddress` if the `call` results in native ETH being sent to the middleman.

## Usage

1.  **Define your target call:** This is the call to the target contract function (e.g., `vault.deposit{ value: amount }()`) that sends assets to `msg.sender`.
2.  **Wrap it:** Use `withExecAndTransfer`, providing the Omni `middlemanAddress`, your original call, the `token` you expect the middleman to receive, and the final recipient (`to`).
3.  **Use the wrapped call:** Pass the result of `withExecAndTransfer` (which is a `Call` object itself) into the `calls` array for `useOrder`.

```typescript
import { withExecAndTransfer } from '@omni-network/core';


// ABI for Vault.deposit{ value: amount }()
const vaultABI = [
    {
        inputs: [],
        name: 'deposit',
        outputs: [],
        stateMutability: 'payable',
        type: 'function',
    },
] as const;

const middlemanAddress = "0x..." as const;  // Omni contract address
const vaultAddress = "0x..." as const;      // Your tokenized vault address
const vaultTokenAddress = "0x..." as const; // The ERC20 token minted by the vault to msg.sender
const vaultDepositAmt = parseEther('1');    // Amount to deposit into the vault
const userAddress = "0x..." as const;       // The final recipient of the vault tokens

// 1. Define the target call (e.g., vault.deposit{ value: amount }())
const targetCall = {
    target: vaultAddress,
    abi: vaultABI,
    functionName: 'deposit',
    value: vaultDepositAmt,
};

// 2. Wrap the call
const wrappedCall = withExecAndTransfer({
    middlemanAddress: middlemanAddress,
    call: targetCall,
    transfer: {
        token: vaultTokenAddress, // Token the middleman should forward
        to: userAddress,          // Final recipient
    }
});

// 3. Use the wrapped call in useOrder's calls array
const order = useOrder({
    // ...
    calls: [wrappedCall],
});
```
