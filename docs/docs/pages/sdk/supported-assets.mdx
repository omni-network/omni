# Supported Assets

Currently, SolverNet primarily supports **like-asset** operations, meaning you deposit an asset on the source chain to cover the expense of the *same type* of asset on the destination chain. This is true for any asset that is pegged 1:1, such as USDC on Base to USDC on Arbitrum; but it also works for ETH to stETH in the same way, since they're directly pegged. Swaps between different assets are not yet enabled via the SDK.

## Asset List

The following tables list the currently supported assets on Mainnet and Testnet networks.

## Native Assets

When dealing with native gas tokens:

*   Use `isNative: true` in the `deposit` or `expense` configuration objects for `useQuote` and `useOrder`.
*   You do not need to provide a `token` address.
*   Ensure the `amount` is specified in the smallest unit (e.g., wei for ETH).

## ERC20 Tokens

When dealing with ERC20 tokens:

*   Use `isNative: false` (or omit it, as `false` is the default) in the `deposit` or `expense` configuration.
*   Provide the correct ERC20 token contract `address` for the respective chain (`srcChainId` for deposit, `destChainId` for expense).
*   Ensure the `amount` is specified in the token's smallest unit (considering its decimals).
