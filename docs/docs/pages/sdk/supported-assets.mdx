# Supported Assets

The Omni SDK and SolverNet currently facilitate cross-chain operations primarily focused on **native gas tokens** (like ETH, MATIC) and **ERC20 tokens**.

<Callout type="info" title="Like-Asset Only">
Currently, SolverNet primarily supports **like-asset** operations, meaning you deposit an asset on the source chain to cover the expense of the *same type* of asset on the destination chain (e.g., deposit ETH on Base to spend ETH on Holesky, deposit USDC on Optimism to spend USDC on Arbitrum). Swaps between different assets are not yet enabled via the SDK.
</Callout>

## Native Assets

When dealing with native gas tokens:

*   Use `isNative: true` in the `deposit` or `expense` configuration objects for `useQuote` and `useOrder`.
*   You do not need to provide a `token` address.
*   Ensure the `amount` is specified in the smallest unit (e.g., wei for ETH).

## ERC20 Tokens

When dealing with ERC20 tokens:

*   Use `isNative: false` (or omit it, as `false` is the default) in the `deposit` or `expense` configuration.
*   Provide the correct ERC20 token contract `address` for the respective chain (`srcChainId` for deposit, `destChainId` for expense).
*   Ensure the `amount` is specified in the token's smallest unit (considering its decimals).
