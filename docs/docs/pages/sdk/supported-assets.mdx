# Supported Assets

SolverNet supports both **like-asset** operations (depositing an asset on the source chain and receiving the same asset type on the destination chain) and **swaps** between different supported assets. They are treated the same way - just input different token addresses. For details on executing swaps, see the [Swaps page](/sdk/swaps.mdx).

## Asset List

You can use the API (https://solver.mainnet.omni.network/api/v1/tokens) to check the current list alongside spend bounds.

The following tables list the currently supported assets on Mainnet and Testnet networks.

### Mainnet

<Mainnet />

### Testnet

<Testnet />

Supported assets are updated frequently. Please ask the Omni team for the most up-to-date list of supported assets, including minimum and maximum limits.

## Native Assets

When dealing with native gas tokens:

*   Use `isNative: true` in the `deposit` or `expense` configuration objects for `useQuote` and `useOrder`.
*   You do not need to provide a `token` address.
*   Ensure the `amount` is specified in the smallest unit (e.g., wei for ETH).

## ERC20 Tokens

When dealing with ERC20 tokens:

*   Use `isNative: false` (or omit it, as `false` is the default) in the `deposit` or `expense` configuration.
*   Provide the correct ERC20 token contract `address` for the respective chain (`srcChainId` for deposit, `destChainId` for expense).
*   Ensure the `amount` is specified in the token's smallest unit (considering its decimals).
