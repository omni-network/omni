# Omni Overview

## The Problem: Fragmentation

The most glaring side effect of the multi-chain world is the fragmentation of users and capital across the crypto ecosystem. This has degraded both the developer and user experiences.

### For Developers

Applications are siloed on individual chains, limiting their ability to reach users across the ecosystem. If a developer wants to reach users across the ecosystem, they have a couple of suboptimal options:

1.  **Deploy multiple copies:** Deploying to multiple chains means each deployment is isolated, must be maintained independently, user bases are fragmented, and network effects are lost.
2.  **Rearchitect for cross-chain:** This forces developers to reason about cross-chain communication, finality risk, platform risk, and longer audits. It turns smart contract development into a distributed systems problem.
3.  **Deploy on a single chain:** This limits the application to the users and capital on that specific chain.

None of these options are ideal.

### For Users

They must navigate complex application frontends, manually select networks, switch RPC endpoints in their wallets, and bridge assets between chains, all while ensuring they have enough gas tokens for the destination chain.

It's a nightmare.

## The Solution: Unified Crypto Experience

Omni simplifies and unifies the crypto ecosystem by abstracting away cross-chain complexity.

### For Developers:

*   Deploy your application on a single chain.
*   Instantly reach users and liquidity across the entire crypto ecosystem.
*   No need to redesign or re-audit contracts for cross-chain functionality.
*   No need to maintain multiple deployments of your application.
*   No need to manage cross-chain logic or worry about cross-chain security.

### For Users:

*   Seamlessly access decentralized applications without bridging, network switching, or managing gas fees across multiple chains.
*   Omni makes the crypto ecosystem feel like a single, unified chain.

Omni ensures that the crypto ecosystem can scale without sacrificing usability or developer experience.

## What is Omni?

Omni is a chain abstraction layer, allowing developers to make their application available to users and liquidity across all supported chains, while only deploying their application on a single chain.

Omni makes the crypto ecosystem feel like a single chain for users â€” no manual bridging, switching RPCs, managing gas, or wallet upgrades are needed to interact with applications powered by Omni. To simplify both user and developer experiences, Omni delegates cross-chain complexity to sophisticated third parties through Omni's **SolverNet**.
