# OMNI Token

OMNI is an ERC-20 token launched on Ethereum L1 (deployed to [`0x36e66fbbce51e4cd5bd3c62b637eb411b18949d4`](https://etherscan.io/token/0x36e66fbbce51e4cd5bd3c62b637eb411b18949d4)) with a maximum supply of 100,000,000.

OMNI tokens can be bridged to the Omni EVM, where they can be staked to enhance network security. In the future, additional OMNI tokens may be issued on the Omni EVM as rewards for validators.

## Utility

OMNI serves several crucial roles within the Omni protocol:

*   **Gas Payments:** OMNI will be used to pay for gas to process both cross-rollup transaction requests and Omni EVM transaction requests. All OMNI gas fees will be burned from circulation.
*   **Staking & Security:** OMNI can be staked by or delegated to Omni validators to contribute to the network's economic security, along with restaked ETH. Staking or delegating OMNI earns rewards.
*   **Governance:** Staking OMNI will allow users to participate in network governance when it is live.

## Staking

Support the network and earn rewards by staking your OMNI on the staking portal:
