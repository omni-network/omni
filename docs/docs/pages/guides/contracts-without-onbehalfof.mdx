# Contracts without "onBehalfOf"

## Overview

This guide demonstrates how to handle contracts that do not support the `onBehalfOf` pattern. And instead, credit positions directly to `msg.sender`.

The solutions presented here only apply to contracts that credit tokenized, transferrable positions.

### 1:1 Deposits

For tokenized positions that mint 1:1 with deposit amount, you can use a simple multi-call order (an order with multiple successive calls).


#### 1:1 ERC20 Deposits

This example shows how to deposit ERC20 tokens into a vault that mint 1:1 with the deposit amount. The order of operations is

1. Deposit into the vault
2. Transfer the vault tokens to the user

The address that receives vault tokens post-deposit is the `SolverNetExecutor` - the contract that executes order calls.


```typescript
const depositToken = '0x...' as const;  // The token to deposit
const depositAmount = parseEther('1');  // Amount to deposit into the vault
const vault = "0x..." as const;         // Your tokenized vault address
const vaultToken = "0x..." as const;    // The ERC20 token minted by the vault to msg.sender
const user  = "0x..." as const;         // The final recipient of the vault tokens

const order = useOrder({
    // ...
    calls: [
        // 1. Deposit into the vault
        {
            target: vault,
            abi: vaultABI, // ABI for Vault.deposit(amount)
            functionName: 'deposit',
            args: [depositAmount],
        },
        // 2. Transfer the vault tokens to the user
        {
            target: vaultToken,
            abi: erc20ABI,
            functionName: 'transfer',
            args: [userAddress, depositAmount],
        },
    ],
    expense: {
        token: depositToken,
        amount: depositAmount,
        spender: vault,
    },
})
```

#### 1:1 Native Deposits

This example shows how to deposit native tokens into a vault that mint 1:1 with the deposit amount. It follows the same pattern as the ERC20 example, with some minor differences (highlighted in comments).

```typescript
const depositAmount = parseEther('1');  // Amount to deposit into the vault
const vault = "0x..." as const;         // Your tokenized vault address
const vaultToken = "0x..." as const;    // The ERC20 token minted by the vault to msg.sender
const user  = "0x..." as const;         // The final recipient of the vault tokens

const order = useOrder({
    // ...
    calls: [
        // 1. Deposit into the vault
        {
            target: vault,
            abi: vaultABI, // ABI for Vault.deposit{ value: amount }()
            functionName: 'deposit',
            value: depositAmount, // ** Send native value to the vault
        },
        // 2. Transfer the vault tokens to the user
        {
            target: vaultToken,
            abi: erc20ABI,
            functionName: 'transfer',
            args: [userAddress, depositAmount],
        },
    ],
    expense: {
        token: depositToken,
        amount: depositAmount,
        // ** No spender needed for native token expense
    },
})
```

## Variable Mint

"Variable mints" refer to vaults that mint an unkown (variable) amount of vault tokens.

<Callout type="info">
    If your vault does not mint 1:1 with deposit amount, but mints a known amount of vault tokens per deposit, you can use the 1:1 deposit pattern above.
</Callout>

For tokenized positions with uknown, variable mint amounts, you can use the [`withExecAndTransfer`](/sdk/utils/withExecAndTransfer.mdx) utility.

<Callout type="info">
    Currently, `withExecAndTransfer` utility only supports native token deposits. Work on ERC20 support, and general UX improvements is ongoing.
