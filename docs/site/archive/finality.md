# Fast Finality

One core goal in the design of the Omni Network is to leverage the incredible, globally distributed computing foundation of Ethereum in combination with the best innovations in the industry that excel exactly where Ethereum falls short. Ethereum is the most decentralized Turing complete computing network in existence. This is an objective reality when measured in terms of geographic distribution, cost to attack and ability to recover from attacks. However, it is simply slow. It also lacks frequent finality.

The Omni Network makes a different set of tradeoffs to perfectly complement the core Ethereum network. It is essential that the foundation of the decentralized web operates with the degree of decentralization that Ethereum provides -- the tradeoffs, however, are unacceptable to end users. In order to onboard billions of people from across the world we need finality that happens in seconds, not minutes.

Omni complements the foundation of the Ethereum network through establishing an infrastructure layer across all rollups that consistently achieves finality in seconds. Omni is an attempt to enhance the global decentralized foundation of Ethereum with the latest innovations in crypto. Through relying on Ethereum where it excels, and using frontier innovations where it does not, Omni is able to provide a solution that elegantly marries security with performance.

A blockchain built for mass adoption of Ethereum
Historically "alternative layer 1" blockchains have competed with Ethereum for users and capital. Omni is designed differently, being a blockchain built specifically to work as part of, and in unison with Ethereum. The Omni Network provides a higher level of abstraction that simplifies the developer and user experience. It is only possible to achieve this in a secure manner by leveraging the Ethereum network and its validator set.
