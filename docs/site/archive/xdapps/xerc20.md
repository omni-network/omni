# Upgrade to xERC20

To upgrade an existing ERC20 token to run on multiple rollups, little changes are required to your core ERC20 logic. The main changes are to enable the ERC20 token to interact with the Omni relaying network through the `IOmniPortal` interface.

## Guide Soon to be Released

The detailed guide for upgrading an existing ERC20 token to run on multiple rollups will be released soon before our testnet. Stay tuned!

## Open Liquidity Network

Join the [Open Liquidity Network](https://www.openliquidity.org/) and help popularize open cross-rollup interoperability standards - solve the problem of L2 liquidity fragmentation with the open [xERC-20 token standard (EIP-7281)](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/erc-7281-sovereign-bridged-tokens/14979). Test xERC-20 cross-rollup interoperability with Omni to open new utilities for your token.
