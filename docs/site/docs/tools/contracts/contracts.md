# Contract and dApp Helpers

Omni includes the following Solidity helpers to help you develop your Omni projects:

- [`XApp`](../../develop/xapp/installation.md) - A base contract that provides a set of common functions and variables for your contracts.
- [`XGreeter`](../../develop/xapp/example.md#xgreeter-contract) - A simple contract that demonstrates how to use the `XApp` contract.
- [`XGreeter Template`](https://github.com/omni/omni-forge-template) - A template that you can use to scaffold a new project with an `XGreeter` contract. Used by the Omni CLI `developer new` command.
- [`XRegistry`](https://github.com/omni-network/omni/blob/main/contracts/src/protocol/XRegistry.sol) - A contract that provides a registry for contracts to register themselves.
