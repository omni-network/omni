# Contract and dApp Helpers

Omni includes the following Solidity helpers to help you develop your Omni projects:

- [`XApp`](../../develop/xapp/installation.md) - A base contract that provides a set of common functions and variables for your contracts.
- [`XGreeter`](../../develop/xapp/example.md) - A simple contract that demonstrates how to use the `XApp` contract.
- [`XGreeter Template`](https://github.com/omni/hello-world-template) - A template that you can use to scaffold a new project with a `Greeter` and `GreetingBook` contract. Used by the Omni CLI `developer new` command.

See the [Awesome Omni](https://github.com/omni-network/awesome-omni) repo for a list of Omni examples and templates that you can use to get started with your Omni projects.
