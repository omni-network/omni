# Vision

Omni is a restaking secured blockchain purpose built to connect all of Ethereum's rollups, empowering developers to build apps across all L2s.

With the launch of rollups the Ethereum ecosystem has solved the problem of expensive transactions. However, this has come at the cost of fragmentation. Now users, their capital and applications are scattered across an array of rollup solutions. Through leveraging new technologies like restaking, Omni solves this fragmentation by providing by far the most secure and simple way to deploy cross-rollup applications for Ethereum developers.

The Omni Network is the first blockchain to derive security from $ETH itself through the use of restaking. This unique innovation empowers developers to build applications that are available across all rollups without adding any complexity to the current development process. All cross rollup functionality is abstracted away from both end users as well as developers to be handled exclusively by the network itself.

Omni provides a simple unified experience for developers seeking to build useful, scalable, and secure decentralized applications. As blockchain ecosystems – especially Layer 2s – proliferate, users and liquidity will become more fragmented. _**The Omni blockchain is the missing piece of infrastructure for Ethereum's modular future.**_
