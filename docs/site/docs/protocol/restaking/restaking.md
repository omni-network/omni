Omni accepts delegated ETH to [EigenLayer](https://www.eigenlayer.xyz/) AVS contracts.

The Omni protocol’s staking implementation involves validators and delegators. Validators are responsible for verifying the authenticity of the protocol’s messages, triggering reward and slashing events, and tracking the staking balances and voting powers of the entire validator set. Delegators are solely responsible for delegating re-staked ETH to their selected validators. These staking processes are facilitated by several smart contracts within the Omni staking protocol and are shown below.
