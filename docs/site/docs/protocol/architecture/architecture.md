# Architecture

Omni is designed to enhance the Ethereum ecosystem's scalability and interoperability. It integrates smart contracts across the Omni Chain EVM and Ethereum rollups for cross-chain interactions, with security ensured by a dPoS validator set, supported by a native token and re-staked ETH through Eigenlayer. This framework enables efficient cross-network storage and contract calls.
