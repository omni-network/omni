# Introduction

Welcome to Omni's Protocol documentation. This section aims to introduce the core functionalities and security mechanisms that define the Omni chain.

## Omni's Dual Role

The Omni chain is engineered to perform two critical functions within the blockchain ecosystem:

### Integrated Consensus

#### Cross-Rollup Message Consensus

Omni serves as a bridge between various rollups, enabling them to communicate seamlessly. This functionality is vital for maintaining coherence and interoperability in the increasingly fragmented blockchain landscape.

#### Omni EVM Operation Consensus

The Omni EVM is a parallel execution environment that operates under the same consensus umbrella as the cross-rollup messages. It empowers developers to build and deploy decentralized applications that can interact with different blockchain networks, all within the Omni ecosystem.

## Security Model

The security of the Omni chain is upheld by a dual-staking mechanism:

- **Restaked \$ETH**: Omni leverages the existing security of Ethereum by allowing participants to restake their Ethereum holdings, contributing to the Omni network's overall security.
- **Staked \$OMNI**: Alongside **\$ETH**, Omni's native token, **\$OMNI**, is staked as a commitment to the network's integrity, aligning incentives and enhancing security.

## Simplified Yet Powerful

While Omni's infrastructure is complex and performant, our goal is to present the information in a digestible format. Throughout the Protocol section, you will find detailed yet accessible content that breaks down how Omni achieves its vision of a universally connected and secure blockchain ecosystem.

In the upcoming pages, we will delve deeper into the specifics of Omni's consensus mechanisms, the architecture of the Omni EVM, the role of staked assets, and much more. Whether you are a developer, researcher, or simply a blockchain enthusiast, these pages will equip you with a thorough understanding of the Omni Protocol.
