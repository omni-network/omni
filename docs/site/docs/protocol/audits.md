# Protocol Audits

As part of our commitment to security and reliability, Omni is currently undergoing comprehensive audits. These audits are essential to ensuring that our protocol meets the highest standards of security and efficiency.

## Ongoing Audits

Currently, our protocol is being audited by:

- [**Sigma Prime**](https://sigmaprime.io/) - A leading information security consultancy specializing in blockchain technology and cybersecurity. Sigma Prime is known for their rigorous audit processes and detailed analysis.
- [**Zellic**](https://www.zellic.io/) - An expert in smart contract auditing and blockchain security, Zellic provides thorough examinations and actionable feedback to enhance the security posture of blockchain projects.

## Audit Reports

The audit reports will be made available upon the completion of the auditing process. Our team is working closely with Sigma Prime and Zellic to finalize the audits. Once the auditors have finished their assessments, we will publish their reports here to provide transparency and insights into the security of the Omni protocol.

Stay tuned for updates regarding the audit results and further details.
