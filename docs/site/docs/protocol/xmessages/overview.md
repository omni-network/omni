# Transaction Flow Overview

Omni is designed to enhance the Ethereum ecosystem's scalability and interoperability. It integrates smart contracts across the Omni Chain EVM and Ethereum rollups for cross-chain interactions, with security ensured by a dPoS validator set, supported by a native token and re-staked **\$ETH** through Eigenlayer. This framework enables efficient cross-network storage and contract calls.

## Following a User Cross-Rollup Action

If we were to follow a simple initiating cross-rollup user call from a rollup (in this example Arbitrum) to another rollup (Optimism), the path taken by the information would look as shown below from a high level.

### Stepwise Walkthrough

:::info Note

An `xapp` is referred to as a smart contract application that exists on multiple chains. In this example, we'll use Arbitrum as the "source chain" and Optimism as the "destination chain".

:::

1. The user calls a function on the xapp contract on Arbitrum that intends to interact with a contract on Optimism.
2. The source xapp contract calls the `xcall` method on the Omni Portal contract on Arbitrum.
3. The Portal contract emits an `XMsg` Event containing relevant data for the destination chain contract call.
4. Validators read the emitted Event, create an `xBlock`, and attest to it.
5. The Relayer service reads the attestations and pushes the information from the `XMsg` in the attested `xBlock` to the destination chain by calling the destination Portal contract's `xsubmit` method.
6. The Portal Contract on the destination chain performs a contract call to the specified method in the destination contract as specified by the original `xcall` in step **2**.
