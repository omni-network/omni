# Global State with Omni

Omni grants the flexibility to use any rollup for central state management, the choice is on the developer. However, there are benefits for using the Omni EVM for global state.

## Why Choose Omni?

### Enhanced Ecosystem for Developers

- **Omni EVM Similarities and Extensions**: Omni's EVM closely mirrors standard rollup EVMs but includes unique predeploys and gas token options that enhance functionality, making it well-suited for global state management.
- **Predeploys and XApps**: Omni could integrate more specialized predeploys like cross-chain cron jobs, and success/revert callback management systems, providing robust solutions for complex application needs.

### Superior Tooling

- **Cross-Chain Development**: Omni seeks to offer tailored tools for managing cross-chain applications seamlessly.
  - **TypeScript Libraries**: To enhance development with powerful, easy-to-integrate libraries. With state management built in.
  - **Custom Explorer**: To aid developers in viewing cross-chain messages and manage global state changes effectively.
  - **Development Environments**: Benefit from environments that support instant finality and reliable transaction propagation.

### Instant Finality and Reliable Messaging

- **Hub and Spoke Model**: Omni's model ensures that messages (xmsgs) sent from the Omni EVM are finalized instantly without compromising on cross-chain cryptographic guarantees. Managing global state from another EVM would be tied to finality waiting times.

## Final Thoughts

The flexibility to choose any rollup for global state management is a significant advantage for developers. However, Omni seeks to cater specifically to this with specialized tools, instant messaging capabilities, and tailored ecosystem present compelling reasons to choose it as your primary platform for global state management.
