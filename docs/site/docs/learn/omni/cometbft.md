# CometBFT: Consensus Engine

At the core of Omni's robust and efficient blockchain infrastructure is CometBFT, a battle-tested consensus algorithm that powers the Omni consensus chain. Drawing from years of research and real-world application, CometBFT offers a secure and scalable foundation for Omni's cross-chain communication protocol.

## What is CometBFT?

CometBFT is a Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus mechanism designed to ensure network agreement in a distributed system, even in the presence of faulty or malicious nodes. Its resilience and efficiency make it an ideal choice for Omni, which aims to provide a reliable cross-rollup and cross-chain communication service.

### Features of CometBFT

- **High Security**: CometBFT's design incorporates advanced cryptographic techniques to safeguard against attacks, ensuring the integrity and finality of transactions on the Omni network.
- **Scalability**: Optimized for performance, CometBFT can process a high volume of transactions while maintaining low latency, supporting Omni's goal of providing a seamless user experience across different blockchain ecosystems.
- **Decentralization**: By allowing broad participation in the consensus process, CometBFT fosters a more decentralized network structure, aligning with the blockchain ethos of distributed authority.

## How CometBFT Powers Omni

- **Cross-Chain Consensus**: CometBFT enables Omni to achieve consensus not just within its own network but also in coordinating state changes across connected blockchains and rollups, ensuring coherent and reliable cross-chain communication.
- **Robust Network Stability**: The resilience of CometBFT against Byzantine faults means that Omni can maintain operational stability even under adversarial conditions, making it a dependable backbone for the protocol.
- **Facilitating Innovation**: With CometBFT at its core, Omni provides a secure platform for developers to build innovative applications that leverage cross-chain capabilities without compromising on performance or security.
