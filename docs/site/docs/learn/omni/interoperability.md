# Rollup Interoperability

At the heart of Omni's mission is the enablement of seamless interoperability between different blockchain networks, particularly focusing on rollup technologies. This capability is essential for creating a cohesive and efficient blockchain ecosystem where assets, information, and applications can freely move across chains.

## Breaking Down Barriers

Traditionally, blockchain networks operate in isolation, creating silos that limit the interaction between different ecosystems. Omni addresses this challenge by providing the necessary infrastructure for rollups to communicate and transact with one another without friction.

### What is Rollup Interoperability?

Rollup interoperability refers to the ability of different rollup solutions, such as Optimistic Rollups and ZK-Rollups, to interact and exchange data. This interaction enables:

- **Cross-chain Transactions**: Users can perform transactions across different blockchain networks, enhancing liquidity and accessibility.
- **Unified Applications**: Developers can create decentralized applications (dApps) that leverage the strengths of multiple chains, offering users a richer experience.
- **Shared Security Model**: By enabling rollups to interoperate, Omni contributes to a shared security model, where the security of one network can benefit others.

## Omni's Approach to Interoperability

Omni's protocol leverages advanced cryptographic techniques and smart contract functionality to ensure secure and efficient cross-rollup communication. Key features include:

- **XMsg Format**: Omni utilizes a specialized message format, XMsg, designed to standardize and secure the transfer of data between rollups.
- **Portal Contracts**: Deployed across connected rollups, these contracts facilitate the verification and execution of cross-chain transactions.
- **EigenLayer Integration**: By building on top of the EigenLayer protocol, Omni extends the cryptoeconomic security of Ethereum to support interconnected rollup operations.
