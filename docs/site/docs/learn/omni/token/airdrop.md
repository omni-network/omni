# Genesis Airdrop

The **\$OMNI** Genesis airdrop event marks a pivotal milestone for Omni on its path towards a fully decentralized network. The Genesis airdrop retroactively rewards the Omni community and its partners across the Ethereum ecosystem with 3,000,000 **\$OMNI** (3% of total supply). The Genesis airdrop went live on April 17, 2024 and is live for 45 days. Unclaimed **\$OMNI** rewards will be returned to the Omni Foundation on June 1, 2024.

The **\$OMNI** Genesis airdrop is broken down across the following categories:
