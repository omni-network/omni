## Delegating \$ETH

:::warning EigenLayer Still Migrating to Holesky

The URL for the EignLayer Dashboard and a list of the supported Omni Operators will be added here soon.

You can delegate testnet **\$ETH** to securing Omni through EigenLayer through the EigenLayer dashboard. Once there you can:

1. Have Holesky as a network to your browser wallet, funded with Holesky **\$ETH**. [Read more on how here](https://www.coingecko.com/learn/holesky-testnet-eth).
2. Swap Holesky **\$ETH** for any of the [EigenLayer supported restaking tokens](https://docs.eigenlayer.xyz/eigenlayer/restaking-guides/restaking-user-guide/stage-2-testnet/obtaining-testnet-eth-and-liquid-staking-tokens-lsts).
3. Connect your wallet to the EigenLayer dashboard.
4. Restake your restaking tokens to any of the Omni Operators.
5. ðŸŽ‰ You are helping secure the Omni Omega Testnet! ðŸŽ‰
