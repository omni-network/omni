# About

Omni is a high performance, high security interoperability network built to aggregate users, liquidity and activity from all rollups, providing developers with the best platform to build cross-rollup applications.

Omni is the future of interoperability for the Ethereum ecosystem that allows developers to build applications that are available across all rollups without fragmenting their liquidity.

Omni abstracts away the complexity of building cross-rollup applications by establishing a global storage layer to manage cross-domain applications, accessing liquidity and users across every ecosystem.Developers can work in a familiar environment – the EVM – and don't need to worry about distributed state management. Instead of fragmenting liquidity, application developers can aggregate it across domains, meeting users where they are and creating a smooth product experience.
