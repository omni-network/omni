# Goal

> **The goal of Omni is to pair an innovative security model with a novel, modular architecture to provide the highest performance interoperability network for rollup application developers.**

Omni is a blockchain specifically designed to unify Ethereum's rollups, mitigating fragmentation by [restaking](../background/restaking.md) for enhanced security and simplicity, allowing developers to create cross-rollup applications effortlessly. It pioneers the use of ETH restaking to bolster security, streamlining the development process by abstracting cross-rollup complexities from users and developers. As the Ethereum ecosystem grows and diversifies, Omni positions itself as the essential infrastructure to support Ethereum's modular evolution, offering a seamless development experience amidst a landscape of increasing rollup networks.
