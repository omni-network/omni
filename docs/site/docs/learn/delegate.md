# Delegating ETH with EigenLayer

Make sure to follow the [EigenLayer Restaking User Guide](https://docs.eigenlayer.xyz/eigenlayer/restaking-guides/restaking-user-guide/) to restake **$ETH** through the EigenLayer app.

Select an operator that is registered with Omni from the options shown in the dashboard.

In case of any doubts feel free to reach out to the community on [Discord](https://discord.gg/bKNXmaX9VD).

<!-- TODO: verify this is actually how that works -->
