# What is Restaking?

Restaking is a transformative concept in blockchain security, introduced by EigenLayer, a protocol built on Ethereum. It represents a new cryptoeconomic security primitive allowing the reuse of staked **\$ETH** to extend cryptoeconomic security to a wide array of applications on the network.

## Introducing EigenLayer

EigenLayer is a groundbreaking protocol that unlocks the potential of staked **\$ETH**, enabling it to secure additional services beyond the consensus layer. It allows users to restake their native **\$ETH** or liquid staking tokens (LSTs) through smart contracts, thereby contributing to the security of various applications while earning additional rewards.

### Why Restaking Matters

Restaking through EigenLayer has several significant advantages:

- **Pooled Security**: Ethereum stakers can restake their staked **\$ETH** to provide pooled security across multiple services, reducing capital costs and elevating trust guarantees for each service.
- **Fragmentation Solution**: By allowing any service to tap into Ethereum's staked security, EigenLayer addresses the fragmentation of security efforts, fostering a cohesive ecosystem for decentralized services.
- **Permissionless Innovation**: EigenLayer's environment supports the seamless introduction of new services, enabling permissionless innovation and free-market governance where stakers choose which services to secure based on their risk-reward preferences.

## EigenLayer: A Hub of Decentralized Services

EigenLayer supports a variety of actively validated services (AVS), including but not limited to:

- Sidechains
- Oracle networks
- Data availability layers
- Bridges and keeper networks

### Core Features of EigenLayer

- **Liquid Staking**: Users can stake their **\$ETH** and receive LSTs, which can be traded or redeemed, allowing for liquidity and participation in DeFi ecosystems.
- **Native and LST Restaking**: Stakers can opt to restake their assets natively or use LSTs to secure additional services within EigenLayer's framework.
- **Delegation and Operators**: Stakers can delegate their staked assets to operators who run the infrastructure required for EigenLayer services, simplifying participation for those who may not wish to operate the software themselves.

## Securing the Future

EigenLayer's innovative approach to restaking and its on-chain slashing mechanisms ensure robust security aligned with the principles of decentralized governance. As a result, EigenLayer sets the stage for a more secure, efficient, and unified blockchain ecosystem.

For an in-depth understanding of restaking and the EigenLayer protocol read more in the [EigenLayer Documentation](https://docs.eigenlayer.xyz/eigenlayer/overview/).

EigenLayer is redefining the landscape of blockchain security by enabling stakers to contribute to the security of the entire network, ushering in a new era of interconnectedness and mutual growth.
