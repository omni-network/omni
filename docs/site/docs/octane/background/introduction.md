# Introduction

Octane is a next-generation modular framework for the EVM. Developers can use octane to run:

- any EVM execution client that implements the [EngineAPI](https://hackmd.io/@danielrachi/engine_api)
- any consensus client that implements [ABCI 2.0](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/tree/main/spec/abci)

Octane is the first consensus implementation of the EngineAPI besides Ethereum itself (the Beacon Chain).

It is designed and built to simplify the integration of the EVM into any blockchain application.
