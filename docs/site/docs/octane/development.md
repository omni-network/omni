# Development and Integration

- **Codebase:** The `octane` modules are part of Omniâ€™s broader consensus chain implementation, called Halo. Our [`evmengine`](https://github.com/omni-network/omni/tree/main/octane/evmengine) and [`evmstaking`](https://github.com/omni-network/omni/tree/main/halo/evmstaking) modules, will soon be refactored into their own top-level directory as the protocol matures. This change will simplify the integration process for other teams, and will still be used by Halo.
- We are excited about the potential of Octane and the capabilities it brings to the Omni network. As we continue to refine and expand this section, we look forward to empowering developers and partners with powerful tools to build the next generation of blockchain applications.
- We encourage teams to fork, experiment, and play around with Octane for your own use cases.

Octane is currently licensed under GPLv3 with an open interoperability requirement. We are working with teams that would like to use this implementation, and if you would like to integrate it into your own application, you can reach out to the Omni team to discuss further.
