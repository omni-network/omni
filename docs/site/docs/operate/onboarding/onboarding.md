# EigenLayer Registration

## Registering as an Operator for Testnet & Mainnet

To register with Omni, operators must first register as an operator on the Eigenlayer smart contracts on Holesky testnet or Mainnet.

This registers your Ethereum public key with the Eigenlayer smart contracts. You can follow Eigenlayer's instructions [here](https://docs.eigenlayer.xyz/eigenlayer/operator-guides/operator-installation).
