# Run the Client

This is the component that participates in network validation. Our consensus clients track delegations and stake from our AVS contracts.

Similar to Ethereum, Omni validators run 2 components: our consensus client, `halo`, and an EVM execution client `geth`, `erigon`, `nethermind`, etc.

<!-- TODO(dennis): include run commands, preferably with CLI -->
