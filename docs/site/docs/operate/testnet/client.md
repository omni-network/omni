# Run the Client

This is the component that participates in network validation. Our consensus clients track delegations and stake from our AVS contracts.

Similar to Ethereum, Omni validators run 2 components: our consensus client, `halo`, and an EVM execution client `geth`, `erigon`, `nethermind`, etc. The EVM execution client does not require any modifications.

This feature is not yet enabled. Please do not attempt to run it.
