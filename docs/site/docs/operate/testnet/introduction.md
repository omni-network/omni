# EigenLayer Registration

## Registering as an Operator for Testnet

To register with Omni, operators must first register as an operator in Eigenlayer testnet.

This registers your Ethereum public key with the Eigenlayer smart contracts. You can follow Eigenlayer's instructions [here](https://docs.eigenlayer.xyz/eigenlayer/operator-guides/operator-installation).
