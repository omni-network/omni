# Introduction

## What Is a Node Operator in Omni?

Operators run Omni node software and play an active role in validating the Omni network.

In all other blockchains, validators can only stake the native token of that chain. With Omni, validators can stake **\$OMNI**, but they can also restake **\$ETH**, via Eigenlayer. Operators can also receive **\$ETH** delegations from other users.

## How Do I Become an Operator?
