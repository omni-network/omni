# Introduction

## What Is a Node Operator in Omni?

Operators run Omni node software and play an active role in validating the Omni network.

Validators must run the Omni client in addition to nodes for all supported chains, since validators attest to xchain blocks. Full nodes don't need to run nodes for supported chains.

Validators stake **\$OMNI**, and can optionally stake **\$ETH** or receive **\$ETH** delegations via Eigenlayer. Many staking features including validator withdrawals, **\$OMNI** delegation, **\$ETH** delegation, and more will be released in the staking network upgrade.
