# Content

These are a few useful notes on the content directory here

- This content is used in the `docs/website` directory.
- The source of truth for ordering is `website/sidebars.ts`.
- There are some files included in the repo that are not added to `website/sidebars.ts`. These are not accessible via the standard navigation flow, but are still hosted in our public docs. They are used for various other purposes, like interviews.
