# Content

These are a few useful notes on the content directory here

- This content is used in the `docs/website` directory.
- Markdown files are numbered (e.g. `learn/1-what-is-omni.md`), to indicate the order in which they should appear in the public docs. However, this is not the source of truth for ordering and is simply there to make it easier to write docs. The source of truth for ordering is `website/sidebars.ts`.
- The `1-{X}.md` files can be linked as `{X}`. For example, although the file is called `operate/2-validator.md`, the link to it in our public docs is `docs.omni.network/operate/validator`.
- There are some files included that are not numbered. These are not navigatable via standard flow, but are still hosted in our public docs. They are used for various other purposes, like interviews.
