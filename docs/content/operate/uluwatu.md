# Network Upgrade: Uluwatu

This guide describes the process to participate in the *critical coordinated* Omni Omega  ‚ÄúUluwatu‚Äù network upgrade (hard fork).  (Omni network upgrades are named after iconic surf spots; Uluwatu is in Bali).

## TL;DR

- Simply ensure the `omniops/halovisor:v0.9.0` docker image is running **BEFORE** the upgrade height.
  - `halovisor:v0.9.0`: wraps cosmovisor with `halo:v0.8.1` and `halo:v0.9.0`
  - It will perform the binary switch automatically at the required block.
- Upgrade name (for Cosmovisor): `1_uluwatu`
- Omega upgrade height: `3 070 000`
- Omega upgrade date: 14 Oct 2024
- Version(s) supported before upgrade: `halo:v0.4.0 .. v0.8.1`
- Version required after upgrade: `halo:v0.9.0`

> üöß Like any blockchain network upgrade (hard fork), nodes that do not upgrade will crash or stall.

## Details

The ‚Äúuluwatu‚Äù upgrade is the first network upgrade (hard fork) planned for the Omni Omega network and is included in the `halo:v0.9.0` release.

The upgrade changes the `x/slashing` module parameters, see [issue](https://github.com/omni-network/omni/issues/2018) for more details.
Quick jailing ensures good network performance. Small inactivity slashing ensures little value is lost in the event jailing.
Validator downtime is mostly disincentivised by missed rewards of long jailing period which is required by XChain security model.

The upgrade also contains changes to `halo`‚Äôs `attest` module logic ensuring that attestations are only deleted when they exit the modified vote window. See [issue](https://github.com/omni-network/omni/issues/1787) and [PR](https://github.com/omni-network/omni/pull/1983) for details.

No changes to `geth` is required, this version is compatible with `v1.14.11`.

See [Run a Full Node](./run-full-node.md#halo-deployment-options) for more details on running `halo` with `cosmovisor`.
