# OMNI Token

**OMNI** is an ERC-20 token launched on Ethereum L1 (deployed to [**`0x36e66fbbce51e4cd5bd3c62b637eb411b18949d4`**](https://etherscan.io/token/0x36e66fbbce51e4cd5bd3c62b637eb411b18949d4)) with a maximum supply of **100,000,000**. When the Omni network is live on mainnet, **OMNI** tokens can be bridged to the Omni EVM, where they can be staked to enhance network security. In the future, additional **OMNI** tokens may be issued on the Omni EVM as rewards for validators.

OMNI will several crucial roles within the Omni protocol. **OMNI** will be used to pay for gas to process both cross-rollup transaction requests and Omni EVM transaction requests. All **OMNI** gas fees will be burned from circulation. **OMNI** can also be staked by or delegated to Omni validators to contribute to the network’s economic security, along with restaked ETH. Staking or delegating OMNI earns rewards and will allow users to participate in network governance when it is live. Before the launch on mainnet, users can help bootstrap the network’s security by participating in the Genesis Staking program by staking their **OMNI** tokens through the [staking portal](https://app.omni.network/).
