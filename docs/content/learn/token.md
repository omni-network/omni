# $OMNI Token

**\$OMNI** is an ERC-20 token launched on Ethereum L1 (deployed to [**`0x36e66fbbce51e4cd5bd3c62b637eb411b18949d4`**](https://etherscan.io/token/0x36e66fbbce51e4cd5bd3c62b637eb411b18949d4)) with a maximum supply of **100,000,000**.

3% of the supply (3,000,000 **\$OMNI**) was distributed at Genesis as part of the Genesis Airdrop.
When the Omni network is launched, **\$OMNI**  will be able to be migrated to the Omni EVM. In the future, additional **\$OMNI** can be created on the Omni EVM for validator rewards.

The **\$OMNI** token serves several crucial roles within the Omni protocol. **\$OMNI** can be used to pay for gas to process both cross-rollup transaction requests and Omni EVM transaction requests.

All **\$OMNI** gas fees are burned from circulation. **\$OMNI** can also be staked by or delegated to Omni validators to contribute to the network’s economic security. Staking or delegating **\$OMNI** earns rewards and will allow users to participate in network governance when it is live. Before the mainnet launch, users can participate in the Genesis Staking program by staking their **\$OMNI** tokens through the [staking portal.](https://app.omni.network/)
