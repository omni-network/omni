# SolverNet

SolverNet is Omni’s solution to the challenges of cross-chain application development and user experience. SolverNet establishes an intent-based architecture that leverages a competitive solver network alongside Omni Core for settlement.

## The Challenge of Cross-Chain Applications

The rapid expansion of rollups in the Ethereum ecosystem has made it increasingly difficult for developers to easily access users and liquidity across these chains. While cross-chain applications have often been viewed as the solution, the industry still faces major adoption obstacles, despite significant investments in interoperability infrastructure. Our discussions with hundreds of developers have revealed two primary challenges:

1. **Extended Development Timelines**: Building a cross-chain application is resource-intensive, requiring up to four months for design, implementation, and security audits. In a fast-evolving industry where most applications are still pursuing product-market fit, this long development cycle is impractical.

2. **Higher Security Risks**: Cross-chain implementations introduce complex smart contracts, increasing vulnerability to hacks. If an interoperability protocol is compromised, all applications relying on it are at risk. This heightened risk has discouraged widespread adoption of cross-chain applications.

These challenges have stagnated cross-chain application adoption and left the fragmentation issue unresolved.

## Omni's Solution

To solve these challenges, Omni introduced SolverNet, an intent-based architecture that establishes a competitive solver network and uses Omni Core for settlement.

This architecture enables:

- Developers build their applications on a single rollup
- Developers reach users and liquidity across the entire Ethereum ecosystem
- Developers bypass the need for complex cross-chain contract deployment
- Users interact with applications on different rollups without needing to bridge assets, change wallets, or worry about gas fees across networks
- Users feel like they're on a single monolithic chain

## Early Adoption and Next Steps

Currently, SolverNet is being tested with select launch partners that manage over $500M in Total Value Locked (TVL). These collaborations are helping refine SolverNet’s architecture for broader adoption.

 If your team would like to be considered as an early build partner as we iterate and expand access to the SDK, please reach out to Omni’s founders, [Austin King](https://x.com/0xASK) and [Tyler Tarsi](https://x.com/ttarsi_), on Twitter (X).
