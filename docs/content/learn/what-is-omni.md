# What is Omni

<img src="/img/omni-intro.png"/>


Omni is a chain abstraction protocol that enables developers to create applications that are accessible across multiple rollups, allowing them to tap into the combined **user** base and **liquidity** of all connected networks.

Omni is built on a novel network architecture tailored for low latency cross-rollup communications and global compatibility with Ethereum’s entire rollup ecosystem, underpinned by the cryptoeconomic security of restaked $ETH. This design achieves low latency cross-rollup message verification while harnessing Ethereum’s industry leading cryptoeconomic security budget. Furthermore, Omni is intentionally designed to be easily integrated with any rollup architecture and local rollup application, while also providing a programmable state layer for managing application deployments across rollups.

With Omni, Ethereum can once again provide a single, unified operating system for decentralized applications, but this time, at a global scale.
