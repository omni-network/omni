# Welcome

Welcome to the Omni documentation! Omni is a technology designed to make the Ethereum ecosystem feel like a single chain for users and developers.

This documentation is your guide to understanding, building with, and operating Omni. Whether you’re here to explore the Omni Orderflow Engine, integrate Omni Core or SolverNet into your application, or run a validator, you’ll find the resources you need to get started.

## What is Omni?

At its core, Omni abstracts away the complexities of cross-chain interactions, enabling:

- **Developers** to deploy applications on a single rollup while reaching users and liquidity across the entire Ethereum ecosystem.
- **Users** to interact with applications on any rollup without bridging, managing gas, or switching networks.

Omni is built around two primary components:

- **Omni Core**: A protocol for decentralized and fast cross-rollup messaging and computation.
- **SolverNet**: A network enabling intent-based execution across chains.

Together, they form the **Omni Orderflow Engine**, infrastructure for coordinating and settling all cross-chain actions.

## The Vision: An Open Orderflow Execution Engine

Traditional finance relies on exclusive systems like Robinhood’s Payment for Order Flow (PFoF) deals with market makers like Citadel. These opaque agreements centralize power and concentrate benefits among a select few.

Omni is building the open alternative: a permissionless orderflow execution engine. Anyone can participate in routing and executing cross-chain intents, ensuring users always get the best execution with full transparency. This infrastructure empowers developers, solvers, and users to build on equitable and open rails, setting the foundation for an equitable global financial system.

## Getting Started

Explore the [Learn](/learn/why) section to dive into Omni’s purpose, architecture, and key components:

- [Why Omni?](/learn/why) Understand the challenges Omni solves.
- [What is the Omni Orderflow Engine?](/learn/what) Learn how Omni Core and SolverNet work together.
- [Omni Core and SolverNet](/learn/core) Discover the details of Omni’s two primary components.

From there, move into the [Build with Core](/core/intro), [Build with SolverNet](/solvernet/intro), or [Operate](/operate/run-full-node) sections for practical guides on using Omni.

We’re excited to have you here as we redefine what’s possible in Ethereum’s rollup-centric future.
