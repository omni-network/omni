# Octane EVM

Because Omni's dual chain architecture uses the Engine API, it is fully equivalent to the EVM used by Ethereum L1.

The Omni EVM includes a suite of preinstalled contracts to simplify development. These preinstalls are optimized for common tasks like multisig wallets, transaction batching, and deterministic contract deployments.

You can find the complete list of preinstalled contracts [here](https://github.com/omni-network/omni/blob/main/contracts/core/src/octane/Preinstalls.sol).
