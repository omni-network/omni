# Intro

Omni Core consists of two components:

- **Cross Chain Messaging**: A protocol for decentralized and fast cross-chain communication.
- **Omni EVM**: An execution layer designed for global computation across chains.

They are both leveraged by SolverNet, but they are permissionless and can be used by any developer.
