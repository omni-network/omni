# Problem We're Solving

## The Challenge of Cross-Chain Applications

Building cross-chain applications is hard. Building on top of a cross-chain messaging protocol introduces many challenges, and in the long run of smart contract development will primarily be used by infrastucture providers and sophistacted actors like solvers rather than apps for end users.

In particular, cross chain app development introduces challenges like:

1. **Complexity**: Cross-chain applications require more complex smart contracts, which are more vulnerable to hacks.
2. **Finality Risks**: Developers of cross-chain applications need to consider chain reorgs, finality risks, and other issues that do not exist on a single chain.
3. **Extended Development Timelines**: Building cross chain applications simply takes way longer than building on a single chain. In a fast-evolving industry where most applications are still pursuing product-market fit, this long development cycle is impractical.
4. **Platform Risk**: App developers need to bet the success of their protocol on the success of a cross-chain messaging protocol, in addition to each of the chains they're built on.

_**SolverNet fixes exactly these problems.**_

1. You don't need to worry about cross chain complexity, because you can build your application on a single chain.
2. You don't need to consider finality risk or reorgs, because solvers take on that risk, not you.
3. You don't need to rearchitect your smart contracts, since you can build them on a single chain.
4. You don't need to risk the success of your protocol on an xchain messaging protocol. You only need to integrate Omni into your frontend!
