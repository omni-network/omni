# Intro

Currently, SolverNet is being tested with select launch partners that manage over $500M in Total Value Locked (TVL). These collaborations are helping refine SolverNet’s architecture for broader adoption.

If your team would like to be considered as an early build partner as we iterate and expand access to the SDK, please reach out to Omni’s founders, [Austin King](https://x.com/0xASK) and [Tyler Tarsi](https://x.com/ttarsi_), on X.
