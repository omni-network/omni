# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The security of the Omni Network is critical. If you discover any security vulnerabilities, we appreciate your help in responsibly disclosing them to us.

To report a vulnerability, please send an email to **security at omni.network**. We kindly request that you provide us with the following details:

- A clear description of the vulnerability and its potential impact.
- Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
- Any additional information or proof of concept that can help us understand and address the issue.

Upon receiving your report, the Omni Network security team will create a confidential GitHub Security Advisory within our repository. This advisory will serve as a private discussion forum where you can communicate directly with our project maintainers about the vulnerability. This process ensures that sensitive information about security vulnerabilities is handled securely and responsibly until an appropriate fix can be developed and deployed.

## Responsible Disclosure

We believe in responsible disclosure and request that you refrain from publicly disclosing any vulnerabilities until we have had sufficient time to investigate and address them. We appreciate your cooperation in helping us maintain the security and integrity of our blockchain network.

## Bug Bounty Program

At this time, we do not have a bug bounty program in place. However, we greatly value the contributions of security researchers and may consider offering rewards on a case-by-case basis for significant vulnerabilities.

## Disclaimer

Please note that this document is subject to change and may be updated as our security practices evolve. We encourage you to check back regularly for any updates or changes.
