# @omni-network/react

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 1be3019: Introduce getAssets core API and useOmniAssets react hook
- 736f1ae: Removed isNative flag from the quote inputs, deposit.token and expense.token are always optional now. By default we assume native when token is not provided, but we also support tokens in which case you need to provide the address.

  This cleans up the interface for consumers as the isNative flag was proving awkward.

### Patch Changes

- b0a2600: Use the new useWatchDidFill hook in useOrder to propagate the destTxHash, but fallback to didFill in case consumers rely on public RPCs

### Breaking changes

- The `withExecAndTransfer` functions is no longer exported by the `@omni-network/react` package, and must instead be imported from `@omni-network/core`.
- Similarly, the following types must be imported from the core pages: `Order`, `OrderStatus`, `Quote`, `Quotable`.

### Other changes

- This version uses the new `@omni-network/core` package internally.
