# Omni SDK core

## Overview

The Omni SDK contains APIs for interfacing with Omni SolverNet, your gateway to any transaction, on any chain.

Note - given we're in alpha, we're still making improvements, particularly on e2e type safety, testing, and documentation. If you have any feedback or requests, please reach out to us (telegram below).

## Documentation

Head over to the [docs](https://docs.omni.network/sdk/getting-started) for detailed documentation and examples on how to get started with the SDK.

## Get in touch

Of course feel free to open an issue or discussion here on github also.
