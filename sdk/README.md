# Omni SDK

## Note - The SDK is in alpha so expect breaking changes

## Overview

The Omni SDK contains React hooks for interfacing with Omni SolverNet, your gateway to any transaction, on any chain. In future, we plan to add additional packages to support other frameworks, and introduce lower level APIs.

## Getting Started

Please see the [React Hooks README](./packages/react/README.md) for more information.
