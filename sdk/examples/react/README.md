# Omni SDK React Example

This example app demonstrates usage of the Omni SDK React hooks, allowing you to use Omni's SolverNet in your React app to support cross-chain transactions.

The example runs on testnet, using the baseSepolia and holesky chains, but feel free to update the config as you see fit!

## Running the example app

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```
